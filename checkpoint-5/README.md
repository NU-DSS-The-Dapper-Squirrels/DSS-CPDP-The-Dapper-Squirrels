## Proposed Visualizations

In this section, we verified our hypothesis by using Natural Language Processing and Google Colab.
We proposed three questions:

1. Compare the Bigram and Trigram in the top 5 highest and lowest socio-economy
status communities.

2. For similar(in contents) complaint summary texts, are they having similar eco-socio status to each other?

3. Is there any bias in the complaint report? In other words, is the complaint report
narrative different from the incident summary?
