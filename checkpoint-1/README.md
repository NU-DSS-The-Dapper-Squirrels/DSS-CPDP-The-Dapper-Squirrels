           lowest.id AS lowest_id, lowest.name AS lowest_name, lowest.median_income AS lowest_incom
    FROM
        (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY CAST( replace(replace(median_income, '$',''),',','') AS INT )DESC ) AS rank, name, id, median_income
        FROM  data_area
        WHERE median_income IS NOT NULL
        ORDER BY rank
        LIMIT 5) AS richest
        LEFT JOIN
            (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY CAST( replace(replace(median_income, '$',''),',','') AS INT )ASC ) AS rank, name, id, median_income

            WHERE median_income IS NOT NULL
            ORDER BY rank
            LIMIT 5) AS lowest
        ON richest.rank = lowest.rank
);

SELECT * FROM income_rank;
```

### What are the neighborhoodsâ€™ income and CRs(complaint record) per capita?
**SOME INSTRUCTION HERE e.g: Run question1.sql or copy and paste the queries below**

**SOME INSTRUCTION HERE e.g: Run question1.sql or copy and paste the queries below**


* For all officers showing in trr table:

SELECT  CAST(count(*) AS float)/CAST(count( DISTINCT officer_id) AS float) AS trr_per_capital
FROM trr_trr;
```
* For all offices showing in officer table:
```sql
SELECT a.total_trr/b.total_officer
FROM
   (SELECT CAST(count(*) AS float) AS total_trr
   FROM trr_trr) AS a,
   (SELECT  CAST(count(*) AS float) AS total_officer
   FROM data_officer) AS b;
```

   FROM data_racepopulation dr,
        (SELECT area_id, sum(count) AS total FROM data_racepopulation GROUP BY area_id) AS population
   WHERE dr.area_id = population.area_id) AS A
WHERE  data_area.id = A.area_id;
```

### What is the top 5 streets in allegation counts for each beat area?
**SOME INSTRUCTION HERE e.g: Run question1.sql or copy and paste the queries below**


```sql
